# yaml_excel
In yaml we will store some connection_info to DB. Because of security needs data will be stored as hash. Some field will be exactly key for unhash the real data
Excel part will be used for read some data from Excel, manipulate with them and put in another place of Excel and store file.
At the moment this part will be almost deprecated - simple read and save in 2 procedures.
